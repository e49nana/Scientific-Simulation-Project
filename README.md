# Scientific Simulation with Python

This repository collects various numerical and symbolic computation exercises using Python.
These were developed as part of the "Einführung in Simulationstools" course at TH Nürnberg.

## Contents

1. Floating-point precision, Decimal, and Rational arithmetic
2. Numerical differentiation and subtraction cancellation
3. Symbolic modeling of disturbed motion
4. Grid generation and norm comparisons
5. Curvature of exponential functions
6. Taylor series approximation errors
7. Eigenvalue sensitivity to matrix similarity
8. Comparison of determinant computation methods
9. Heron's method (Babylonian method) for square roots
10. Plotting functions and tangents with SymPy and Matplotlib
